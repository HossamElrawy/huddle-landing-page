## How to Use
1. Link the CSS files to the HTML file using the `<link>` tag in the `<head>` section of the HTML document.

   <link rel="stylesheet" href="header.css">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="main.css">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="footer.css">
   <link rel="stylesheet" href="general.css">
   ```
2. Ensure the folder structure keeps the CSS files in the same directory as the HTML file or adjust the paths accordingly.
3. Open the HTML file in a browser to view the styled webpage.
